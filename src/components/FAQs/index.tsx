        question: "How long does shipping typically take?",
        answer: "Our standard shipping takes 3-5 business days within the country. International orders may take 7-14 business days depending on customs processing in your region. You will receive a tracking link via email as soon as your package leaves our warehouse."
    },
    {
        question: "What is your return and exchange policy?",
        answer: "We offer a 30-day return policy for all unworn items with original tags. Exchanges are free of charge, while returns for a refund incur a small processing fee. Please note that sale items are eligible for exchange or store credit only."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I find the right size for me?",
        answer: "Each product page features a detailed size guide. We recommend measuring a similar garment you already own and comparing it to our size chart for the most accurate fit. If you are between sizes, we generally suggest sizing up for a more comfortable, relaxed fit."
    },
    {
        question: "Are your materials sustainably sourced?",
        answer: "Yes, we prioritize ethical sourcing. 80% of our current collection is made from organic cotton or recycled materials, and we are working toward 100% by 2027."
    },

        question: "Do you offer international shipping?",
